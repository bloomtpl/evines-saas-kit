# How to Launch your SaaS in 2026

The landscape of software development has shifted. In 2026, building a SaaS is no longer about who has the most features, but who can deliver **value and trust** the fastest. Here is how you can leverage modern tools to launch in record time.

## 1. The New Tech Stack

Gone are the days of spending weeks configuring your database and authentication. With this **Next.js Starter Kit**, you have a solid foundation:

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Auth:** Auth.js (NextAuth) with Magic Links
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with Premium Dark Mode
- **Database:** Prisma + PostgreSQL

> "The speed of execution is the only sustainable competitive advantage in the AI era." — _Tech Founder_

## 2. Setting up your Environment

To get started with this boilerplate, you simply need to clone the repo and install dependencies. Here is a quick example of how we handle API routes now:

```typescript
export async function GET() {
  const session = await auth();
  if (!session) return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });

  return Response.json({ message: "Welcome to the future of SaaS" });
}
```
